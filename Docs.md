# SIMPLE KNN METHOD IMPLEMENTATION
## What is KNN?
Is a supervised machine learning algorithm that can be used to solve both classification and regression problems. 
The KNN algorithm assumes that similar things exist in close proximity. In other words, similar things are near to each other.

## Dataset used for this project

### Pelvic Incidence:
Pelvic incidence is defined as the angle between a line perpendicular to the sacral plate at its midpoint and a line connecting this point to the femoral head axis.
### Pelvic Tilt
Is the orientation of the pelvis in respect to the thighbones and the rest of the body. The pelvis can tilt towards the front, back, or either side of the body.

### Lumbar lordosis Angle
Is an ideal parameter for the evaluation of lumbar lordosis. The normal value of LLA can be defined as 20-45 degrees

### Sacral Slope
Is defined as the angle between the horizontal and the sacral plate, and is a critical spinal parameter in the analysis of sagittal balance that has been correlated to the progression of spondylolisthesis.
### Pelvis Radius
The distance from the hip axis to the posterior-superior corner of the S1 endplate.

### Grade of spondylolisthesis
Spondylolisthesis is a spinal condition that affects the lower vertebrae (spinal bones). This disease causes one of the lower vertebrae to slip forward onto the bone directly beneath it. Is graded by measuring how much of a vertebral body has slipped forward over the body beneath it. 

#### What is normal?
The value for the pelvic incidence was provided as normal between 43° and 62°. The normal range of value for the sacral slope was from −32° to −49°, from 3° to 18° for the pelvic tilting.
